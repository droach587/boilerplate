This is a simple boilerplate using foundation 5, modular scss, grunt and compass. 

**Installation**

 1. Pull the latest master branch
 2. Copy and paste the entire contents of the build into your working directory
 3. Open your terminal and cd into your working directory or drag and drop your working folder over your terminal icon for the same effect
 4. Install bundler gemfile dependencies (`bundler install`)
 5. Once complete, install node dependencies `(npm install`)
 6. From there, simply execute `grunt` in your working directory, and all css, javascript and images will build and output.

**Notes:**

Images are generated on the fly, dump all assets into the source directory for output into img

If you don't want to auto optimize images, simply add them to the /img directory

compass and all JS are minified on build
