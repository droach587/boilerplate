** Notes on SASS **

Module Breakdown
- container
- content
- layout
- utilities

**container**
Large modular elements, non-stylized, non-thematic (although can be )

**content**
Bulk of the site's thematic markup, vertical and horizontal rhythm

**layout**
Large structural elements, basic position
Default general theme falls here

**utilities**
Helper classes

**media-queries**
delete this folder if you're not using the general layout
mq's should occur on a modular basis, and be within a media-query folder specific to that module.
